# Effective C: A Journey Through the Book

This repository documents my journey as I work through *Effective C* by Robert C. Seacord. My goal is to **master C programming** by reading the book cover to cover, writing and testing every code example, and building a strong foundation in C concepts, best practices, and advanced topics.

## About the Book
*Effective C* is a comprehensive guide to writing efficient, portable, and maintainable C code. It covers both fundamental and advanced topics, making it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of the C programming language.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a section of the book (e.g., `1_20`, `21_40`) and contains:
- **Code Snippets:** Implementations of examples and exercises from the book.
- **Notes:** Detailed explanations, key concepts, and personal insights.
- **README.md:** An overview of what was covered in that section.
