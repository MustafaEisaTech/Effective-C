# Pages 1-20: Introduction and Fundamentals

This folder contains my notes and code snippets from pages 1-20 of *Effective C* by Robert C. Seacord.

## What I Learned
- **Freestanding vs. Hosted Environments:** Understanding where and how C programs run.
- **Function Return Types:** Checking return values and what they mean.
- **Macros:** Using `#define` for constants and code snippets.
- **Compiler Implementations and Portability:** How different compilers handle C code.
- **Portability Issues:** Challenges with implementation-defined, unspecified, and undefined behavior.
- **Hosted Environment and `main` Return:** How the OS checks the return value of `main`.
- **Types in C:** Objects, functions, and pointers.
- **Variable Declarations:** How to declare and use variables.
- **Scoping:** File scope, block scope, function prototype scope, and function scope.
- **Storage Duration:** Automatic, static, thread, and allocated storage.
